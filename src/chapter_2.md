## OOPS



### The Struct Functions or Methods

#### Constructor

- Constructors in rust are called `new`

- They are defined under the `impl` block.

  ```rust
  impl Server {
      fn new(addr: String) -> Server {
          Server {
              addr: addr
          }
      }

      ...
  }
  ```

- We can improve the way we write constructors by renaming the struct name with the alias `Self` and passing one word in the case of common variable names.

  ```rust
  impl Server {
      // Notice we replaced Server with Self everywhere
      fn new(addr: String) -> Self {
          Self {
              // We only need to pass *addr* as it is common in
              // constructor argument and in the struct declaration
              addr
          }
      }

      ...
  }
  ```

#### Other Functions

- We can pass `self` as an argument to the functions of an struct.

- The `self` keyword gives the total ownership of the instance of a struct.

- It works similar to the `this` keyword in JavaScript.

- We can also pass `&self` and `&mut self` as an argument to a function.

  ```rust
  impl Server {
      fn new(addr: String) -> Self {
    ...
      }

      fn run(self) {
    ...
      }
  }
  ```






## Advanced Features

- The `unimplemented!()` macro
- We can call it inside any function where we want to suppress errors.
- In Rust the code don’t even compile if it contains error but when this macro is written inside a function which has no code inside of it The code will compile but will cause panic when the code runs and that particular function is called.

### Formatting Tricks

- `{:?}` formats the "next" value passed to a formatting macro, and supports anything that implements Debug.

### Netcat commands

- Pipe some data to the server.

```zsh
echo <String> | netcat <IP Address> <Port>
// echo "TEST" | netcat 127.0.0.1 8080
```




### The `or` function

- This function is used to handle the result and error variables.
- If the result is ok, then it will return the unwrapped result, if error happens, it will return the error passed in the or function.
- There is a question mark in the end, which is a shorthand for match block, if we don’t use qn mark, we’ll have to still use the match block with or fn.

```rust
// Traditional Method
match str::from_utf8(buf) {
    Ok(request) => {},
    Err(_) => return Err(ParseError::InvalidEncoding)
}

// Using or function
str::from_utf8(buf).or(Err(ParseError::InvalidEncoding))?;
```

#### Difference between Question Mark and Match Pattern

- Question Mark will try to convert the error type that it receives, if it does not match the error type, that the function is supposed to return.

### The `ok_or` function

- It is similar to `or` function. The difference is that if the output is not an error, it will first unwrap then wrap again inside a result, which has ok and error.

### The `if let` method

```rust
// Method 1
match path.find('?') {
    Some(i) => {
        query_string = Some(&path[i+1..]);
        path = &path[..i];
    }
    None => {}
};


// Method 2
let q = path.find('?');
if q.is_some() {
    let i = q.unwrap();
    query_string = Some(&path[i+1..]);
    path = &path[..i];
}

// The if let method
if let Some(i) = path.find('?') {
    query_string = Some(&path[i+1..]);
    path = &path[..i];
}
```

### Lifetimes

- Let’s consider we have string slices pointing to some parts of buffer.
- What will happen to those string slices if we _deallocate_ the buffer (free the memory or remove contents of buffer)?
- Basically the string slices will point to the dead memory (or empty memory).
- This is known as **Dangling References** or **Use After Free**.
- Another way to re pharse it is to say, “The string slices has a longer lifetime than a buffer”.
- In, C/C++, Dangling References can happen on runtime.
- In High Level Languages, Garbage Collector prevents Dangling References by not allowing to deallocate the buffer.
- But Rust guarantees no Dangling References, without using a Garbage Collector.
- Rust compiler statically checks all the references in our code and ensure that there is no Dangling References.
- It means that there are no performance penalties unlike high level languages.
- Rust requires us to annotate the Lifetime Specifiers so that the compiler is able to statically check the references.

```rust
// The example of a lifetime

pub struct Request<'a> {
    path: &'a str,
    query_string: Option<&'a str>,
    method: Method,
}
```

- It does not mean that we define the lifetimes of a particular variable. Instead we help the rust compiler to identify that two entities share the same lifetime.

### Runtime Detection of a Function (Dynamic Dispatch)

- A dynamic dispatch is a way to tell rust to identify a correct function for whichever trait the user passes as argument.
- Consider a macro Write, it has it's implementation for Vectors, TcpStream etc.
- Now we want to create a function that is generic, and use the write function implemented by individual trait when we pass the trait.

- It's implementation with dynamic dispatch. (`dyn`).

```rust
pub fn send(&self, stream: &mut dyn Write) -> IoResult<()> {
    let body = match &self.body {
        Some(b) => b,
        None => ""
    };

    write!(
        stream,
        "HTTP/1.1 {} {}\r\n\r\n{}",
        self.status_code,
        self.status_code.reason_phrase(),
        body
    )
}
```

### Compiletime Detection of a Function (Static Dispatch)

- A static dispatch is similar to Dynamic dispatch, the difference is that recognizes the correct function during compile time instead on the runtime.
- It is used with the `impl` keyword.
- It actually reads the code during compile time and then chooses the desired function from the code that we have written.

```rust
pub fn send(&self, stream: &mut impl Write) -> IoResult<()> {
  ...
}
```

### Environment Variables

- The environment variables in rust can be used using a standard library.

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let public_path = env::var("PUBLIC_PATH").unwrap();
}
```

- There is a macro to retrieve the project's root directory.

```rust
let default_path = env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR");
```

### Piping Expanded code to a file using vscode

- This command helps to save a single expanded file to a new file.

```zsh
rust expand | code -
```

### File System operations

- It converts the contents of a file into a string.

```rust
let path = "path/to/file"
fs::read_to_string(path)
```

### Convert result into option

- Ok() -> Some()
- Err() -> None

```rust
fs::read_to_string(path).ok()
```

### New Learning Concepts

- Assigning a value to a variable is called _binding_.
- At default, bindings are immutable (not changeable).
- To make bindings immutable we need to add `mut` keyword before variable name.
- Rust uses curly braces `({})` to define a scope. A binding defined within a scope can't escape from it.

```rust
let a = 1;
dbg!(a); // 1
{
    // Here, we re-bind `a` to a new value, which is still immutable.
    // This technique is called _shadowing_. The new binding is constrained to
    // this anonymous scope. Outside this scope, the previous binding still
    // applies.
    let a = 2;
    let b = 3;
    dbg!(a, b); // 2, 3
}
// can't use `b` anymore because it is out of scope
// dbg!(b);

// The shadowed `a` in the inner scope above has fallen out of scope,
// leaving us with our original binding.
dbg!(a); // 1
```

- Outer doc comments are formed with the keyword ///, which acts identically to the // keyword. They apply to the item which follows them, such as a function:

```rust
/// The `add` function produces the sum of its arguments.
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 { x + y }
```

- Inner doc comments are formed with the keyword //!, which acts identically to the // keyword. They apply to the item enclosing them, such as a module:

```rust
mod my_cool_module {
    //! This module is the bee's knees.
}
```

### enums

- Enums, short for enumerations, are a type that limits all possible values of some data.
- The possible values of an enum are called variants.
- Enums also work well with match and other control flow operators to help you express intent in your Rust programs.

### crates

- In rust, packages are called crates.

### tuples

- Tuples are a lightweight way to group a fixed set of arbitrary types of data together.
- A tuple doesn't have a particular name; naming a data structure turns it into a struct.
- A tuple's fields don't have names; they are accessed by means of destructuring or by position.

```rust
// pointless but legal
let unit = ();
// single element
let single_element = ("note the comma",);
// two element
let two_element = (123, "elements can be of differing types");

```

- Access by destructuring

```rust
let (elem1, _elem2) = two_element;
assert_eq!(elem1, 123);
```

- Access by position

```rust
let notation = single_element.0;
assert_eq!(notation, "note the comma");
```

- Tuple Structs

- Like normal structs, these are named types; unlike
  normal structs, they have anonymous fields.
- Their syntax is very similar to normal tuple syntax. It is
  legal to use both destructuring and positional access.

```rust
struct TupleStruct(u8, i32);
let my_tuple_struct = TupleStruct(123, -321);
let neg = my_tuple_struct.1;
let TupleStruct(byte, _) = my_tuple_struct;
assert_eq!(neg, -321);
assert_eq!(byte, 123);
```

### Field Visibility

- All fields of anonymous tuples are always public.
- However, fields of tuple structs have individual
  visibility which defaults to private, just like fields of standard structs.
- You can make the fields
  public with the `pub` modifier, just as in a standard struct.

```rust
// fails due to private fields
mod tuple {
  pub struct TupleStruct(u8, i32);
}

fn main() {
  let _my_tuple_struct = tuple::TupleStruct(123, -321);
}
```

```rust
// succeeds: fields are public
mod tuple {
  pub struct TupleStruct(pub u8, pub i32);
}

fn main() {
  let _my_tuple_struct = tuple::TupleStruct(123, -321);
}
```

### Adding elements with their frequency to a HashMap using entry

- You can follow this [link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.entry).

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut letters = HashMap::new();

for ch in "a short treatise on fungi".chars() {
    let counter = letters.entry(ch).or_insert(0);
    *counter += 1;
}

assert_eq!(letters[&'s'], 2);
assert_eq!(letters[&'t'], 3);
assert_eq!(letters[&'u'], 1);
assert_eq!(letters.get(&'y'), None);
```

### Attributes

- Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code.

```rust
// Syntax
// InnerAttribute :
   # ! [ Attr ]

// OuterAttribute :
   # [ Attr ]
```

#### The `derive` attribute

- It is applied to `struct` or `enum`.
