# Benefits of using rust

- Memory Safe
  - Chromium Project has 70% vulnerabilities related to Memory.
  - C/C++ doesn’t provide Memory Safety
  - Python, JS provides Memory Safety but uses Garbage Collector
  - Rust provides Memory Safety without using Garbage Collector.
  - Rust achieves this functionality by making the language typed, thus the code won’t compile if any vulnerability will exist.
- No Null Types or No Null Pointers
  - Null Pointers in C are used as `*ptr = NULL`.
  - Rust uses it’s rich type system to represent the absence of a value.
- No Exceptions
  - Rust Provides No Direct Referencing, No Pointers and No Pointer Exceptions.
- Modern Package Manager
  - It uses Package Manager named _Cargo_.
- No Data Race
  - A data race occurs when:
    - two or more threads in a **single process** access the same memory location concurrently, and
    - at least one of the accesses is for writing, and
    - the threads are not using any exclusive locks to control their accesses to that memory
  - Game Changer for writing Asynchronous Code
